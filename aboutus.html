        <h1>About SymptoNet</h1>
       <p>SymptoNet is a web app which allows the user to be more informed about his/her wellbeing. You can select the symptoms that you have, and based on them
        the app will give you a list of possible diseases that you might have. The list will contain from the most likely diseases to the least likely.
        The app is not meant for self diagnosis, but rather to give you an idea of what you might have.
